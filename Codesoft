Title: Number Guessing Game
Program:
import java.util.Random;
import java.util.Scanner;
public class NumberGuessingGame {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        Random rand = new Random();

        int attempts = 0;
        int maxAttempts = 10;
        boolean hasWon = false;

        System.out.println("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!");
        System.out.println("I have selected a number between " + lowerBound + " and " + upperBound);
        System.out.println("You have " + maxAttempts + " attempts to guess the number.");

            }

            System.out.println("Attempts remaining: " + (maxAttempts - attempts));
        }

        if (!hasWon) {
            System.out.println("You've used all your attempts. The correct number was: " + number);
        }
    }
}
Output
